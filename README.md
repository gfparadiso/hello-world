  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Highly versatile professional with a strong skill set that includes graphic design, web development, UI/UX design, marketing, and project management. Proven expertise in Adobe Creative Suite, Affinity, Procreate, and Google Suite. Skilled in e-commerce management, content creation, and digital asset management.

  <p>
    I currently study web development and build portfolio projects that combine clean front-end code with practical design systems. I also handle real-world production work—for example, formatting large PowerPoint decks for medical conferences at <strong>WebMD</strong>—which means I care about versioning, deadlines, and pixel-level accuracy.
